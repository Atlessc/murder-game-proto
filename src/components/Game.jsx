  //  code explained for the following function
  // 1. The moveCharacter function takes in the characterRoomTracker object, characters array, charMoved value, and setCharMoved function as arguments.
  // 2. The characterRoomTracker object is an object that contains the rooms as keys and the characters in each room as values. It represents the current state of the game.
  // 3. The characters array contains the characters in the game.
  // 4. The charMoved value represents the index of the character in the characters array that is currently being moved.
  // 5. The setCharMoved function is used to update the charMoved value.
  // 6. The first thing the moveCharacter function does is get the character that is currently being moved. It does this by using the charMoved value to get the character from the characters array.
  // 7. Next, the moveCharacter function finds the current room of the character. It does this by looping through the characterRoomTracker object and finding the room that contains the character.
  // 8. Then, the moveCharacter function creates a list of available rooms. It does this by filtering out the current room from the characterRoomTracker object.
  // 9. Next, the moveCharacter function shuffles the available rooms. It does this by looping through the available rooms and swapping each room with a random room.
  // 10. Then, the moveCharacter function chooses a random room. It does this by using the Math.floor and Math.random functions to choose a random index from the available rooms.
  // 11. Next, the moveCharacter function moves the character to the new room. It does this by removing the character from the current room and adding the character to the new room.
  // 12. Finally, the moveCharacter function updates the charMoved value. It does this by using the setCharMoved function to set the charMoved value to the next index in the characters array.
